Nowadays, the investigation of Gene-Trait association through literature mining is of utmost importance for plant cultivation and seed breeding. In recent years, various works were done to curate both the gene and the trait phenotypes reported in literature in a manual or automatic way. Thanks to the contribution of BioNLP community, gene mention recognition is a well solved problem , but unfortunately, Trait Ontology (TO) mapping is empirically more challenging. Actually, there are a huge amount of ontology terms, i.e., 1,554 Plant Trait Ontology (PTO) terms defined in PTO database, https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PTO, and there are great many variations of the trait description among texts.

In order to propel the research of trait mapping in plant-related literatures, our team is proposing a ``Plant Trait Ontology Mapping of 2k Literatures" for BLAH6, which consists of three open tasks and provides curated data set. The proposal is to encourage a joint research among BioNLP community towards the TO ontology mapping, trait specification of plant science papers, and gene-trait association studies in rice.
